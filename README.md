# Custom GRF for ClassicRO

Release this Chroma/RGB Cursor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c85IA_NJ40

Original Features:
- Minimal Wizard skills, custom animations! (SG, MS, LOV, Quagmire, Fire Wall)
- Reduced SPP Heal Effect to 3px (doesn't help with the visual lag when SPP is spammed, in my experience, so I just minimized it instead of removing it completely)
- Minimal Safety Wall effect with 3px height, effectively making it a 'ground' effect.
- Increased Wall of Fog to 6px height for visibility.
- Sanctuary ground effect is now black but meh.. who cares. At least you can see it still. It's not the same as Wall of Fog effect anyway.
- Custom Pneuma animation with countdown and affected area, and the number is right on the tile where Pneuma was cast (center of 3x3 area)
- Pneuma and Sanctuary "affected cells" have been minimized further from a shade to just an outline.
- Most WOE buffs and priest buffs have a similar animation to Increase AGI, with the skill name/effect being shown)
- Some WOE debuffs have a similar effect to Decrease AGI
- Dispell and Lex Aeterna have a similar animation to Decrease AGI, but both have a "Target" animation so your guild knows who to focus fire on
- Useful WOE materials (used for brewing and for repairing barricades/guardian stones) are made bigger so they are easier to loot
- Yellow Spirit Spheres and Yellow "Fury/Critical Explosion Aura" because it looks good if your server has the Goku hair costume(also easier to see).
- Transparent skill bar that works for both old and new clients
- Some buffs have the buff name in the icon/timer below the minimap
- /hlp says Buff instead of Help
- Text-based Status Effects, including Chaos and Mute (that don't look ugly)
- Smokie Falcons!
- Neon Green Arrows for better Arrow Shower / Sharp Shooting visibility
- Simplified Bolt Skills, reduced opacity and minimized effects
- Transparent Ice Wall
- Taekwon Love! Warm Wind skill effect shows the element, and the buff icon also shows the element.
- Blue Tiled Maps (WOE Castles only) generated with GRF Editor, and edited WOE:SE castles to mark Flags, Spawn Points and Barricade Repair NPCs.

    To warp around the map, click on the small Prontera Flags
    To kill people warping from flags, target the tiny Clock Tower? Spawn Points
    To repair barricades, click on the Eyeballs
